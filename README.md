- **Client**: [Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)
- **Server**: [Deploy to Railway](https://railway.app/new)

## Game Rules

- **Players**: 4 players in 2 teams (Team 0: positions 0&2, Team 1: positions 1&3)
- **Deck**: 32 cards (7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A in all 4 suits)
- **Objective**: Clear your team's points debt

### Points System (Debt Tracking)
- Both teams start at 0 kalyas
- Only one team has kalyas (debt) at a time
- Team with kalyas shuffles
- Shuffling team needs 4 tricks to win round → subtract 10 points
- Non-shuffling team needs 5 tricks to win round → add 5 points to shuffling team's account
- 32 points = 1 laddo
- Points are always positive (deficit)
- **Display**: Kalyas shown = points % 32 (remainder after laddos)

### Vakhaai (Solo Betting)
- After first 4 cards dealt, any player can call vakhaai
- Bet amounts: 4, 8, 16, or 32 points
- Must reach team's target (4 or 5 tricks) to win
- Win: subtract bet from calling team's points
- Lose: add 2x bet to calling team's points

### Game Flow
1. **First 4 cards** dealt to each player
2. **Vakhaai check** - any player can bet or skip
3. **Hukum selection** - one player from non-shuffling team chooses trump (alternates each round)
4. **Remaining 4 cards** dealt
5. **Play 8 hands** - hukum caller plays first, then clockwise
6. **Round ends** when team reaches target (4 or 5 tricks)
7. **Continuous play** - players keep remaining cards, play next round
8. **New deck** dealt only when all cards exhausted
